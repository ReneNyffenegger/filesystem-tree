We're excited to announce release 2.0, our latest major update.

This version includes many new features and improvements that we're confident
our users will love.

First and foremost, we've completely overhauled the user interface.
Our team has worked tirelessly to make the interface more intuitive and
user-friendly, with a cleaner and more modern design. We've also added new
customization options, so users can tailor the interface to their specific
needs and preferences.

In addition to the interface improvements, we've added a variety of new
features that we think our users will find useful. One of the most exciting is
the new integration with a popular third-party service, which will allow users
to easily share their work and collaborate with others.

We've also improved the performance of the software, particularly for large
projects with many files or complex data sets. This means users can work more
efficiently and get their work done faster.

Finally, we've made several quality-of-life improvements based on
feedback from our users. We take your feedback seriously and are always
striving to make the software the best it can be.
